# COM-310-PROJECT
This is the code for the assigned project for COM-310. 

Assumptions for the project:
  1) Up to 10 processes can be in the ready queue at one time. 
  2) The burst times of each process can range from 1 time unit to 10 time units. 
  3) The arrival time of each process can range from 0 time units (i.e. arrive immediately) to 50 time units. 
  4) If there are two or more processes which arrive at the same time, the one which gets executed first is the one with the shortest burst time (see Assumption #7). 
  5) The priority of any given process can range from 1 to 100 where a higher number implies a higher priority.  
  6) If there are two processes with the same priority, the one which gets executed first is the one with the shortest burst time (see Assumption #7). 
  7) If two processes has the same burst time, then the processes are chosen at random and thereafter executed.
